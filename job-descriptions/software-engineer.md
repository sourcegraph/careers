# Software Engineer (San Francisco or remote)

### About the company

From sustainable energy systems to self-driving cars, the innovations of the future will all rely on code. With so much software to write, developers need a better way to access, understand, and collaborate on code.

At Sourcegraph, we are building a better, smarter foundation for software development. One that will enable developers (and the companies that rely on them) to more quickly turn great ideas into groundbreaking technology. Effectively, we want to bring the future sooner.
Check out what we are building for developers and why it matters: https://sourcegraph.com/plan.

### About the team

Our small team consists of talented, mature, collaborative, driven individuals who are attracted to the massive problem we are tackling. We work in an open environment that treats people in a first-class manner and provides them with ownership, responsibility, and autonomy.

### About the role

You will:

- Help build Sourcegraph, a multi-tier application (web, CLI, browser extensions, API, data stores, services) written primarily in TypeScript (frontend) and Go (backend).
- Have the freedom to creatively tackle various CS challenges while building products and infrastructure that are fundamental to the growth and success of the business.
- Have the opportunity to interact directly with our customers to help them deploy/configure our software, and solve issues that they encounter.
- Plan your own work each month based on company goals and customer feedback.
- Publish blog posts and give conference talks about your work at Sourcegraph.

As a senior member of the team, you will:

- Help set the technical direction of various projects.
- Mentor and teach other team members.

This is a full-stack role and ideal candidates should feel comfortable (though not equally skilled) contributing to any part of our codebase.

#### Ideal candidates have

- A track record of delivering high-quality products with attention to scalability and UX.
- Strong web/JavaScript/TypeScript/Go fundamentals.
- Experience working with APIs and distributed systems.
- Passion for the craft of software development and good engineering practices.

#### Example projects

As an engineer at Sourcegraph, you will have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects. It is also ok if you prefer to specialize.

##### Web

- Make our search results page infinite scroll without any visible latency or stuttering.
- Create a sharable hover tooltip library that works on Sourcegraph.com as well as on all of the code hosts that we support (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Phabricator, etc.) via our browser extensions.
- Implement auto-complete typeahead for search queries.
- Write robust end-to-end tests for our website and browser extensions.
- Create the Sourcegraph browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

##### Clients

- Create a `src` CLI command that makes it easy for customers to perform common operations against our APIs.
- Create Sourcegraph editor extensions (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Atom, Intellij, Sublime) that allow developers to use Sourcegraph without breaking their flow.

##### Backend

- Create a system to perform fast, real-time, cross-repository `git grep`.
- Create a platform that allows our customers to extend the functionality of Sourcegraph.
- Make our code search and code intelligence scale to 10,000+ repositories and massive mono-repositories without overloading our customer's code hosts.
- Add support for new code hosts to Sourcegraph.
- Reduce P95 latency of requests to our API (e.g. hover tooltips, find references, go-to-definition).

##### Operations

- Streamline how customers configure and deploy Sourcegraph to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Improve our CI infrastructure to be faster and more reliable.
- Scale our Kubernetes cluster to meet traffic demands and avoid OOMs, while minimizing/optimizing the infrastructure costs for ourselves and for our customers.
- Implement zero downtime deploys of Sourcegraph.
- Standardize how we do logging and telemetry across all our systems.
- Increase the observability of our systems so we can figure out what is wrong when issues are reported.

### Interview process

1.  You [apply here](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/sourcegraphcom/view/P_AAAAAADAAADP_pY7jAAAXU).

    - Please include a cover letter that explains why you are interested in Sourcegraph.
    - Try out our product (e.g. code search and browser extension) and let us know what feedback you have.
    - If you have any non-trivial code samples that you can share with us (e.g. your own open source projects, or contributions to other projects) we would love to look at that.

2.  We schedule a 30 minute introductory phone call to tell you more about Sourcegraph, the share what we are looking for in a candidate and to find out what you are looking for in your next role.
3.  We offer you the option to work on a real world paid project with us. This gives you a chance to see the kind of real world problems that we work on and gives us another data point to consider in case interviews aren't your forte. A good project can substitute for one coding interview.
4.  We schedule a 1 hour technical phone interview.
    - We will write some code in a tool like https://coderpad.io.
    - We avoid trick questions and problems that require a single epiphany to solve.
5.  We fly you out to our San Francisco office for a few more hours of interviews and to meet the team.

    - We will write some code in your preferred editor or in a tool like https://coderpad.io (not a whiteboard).
    - We avoid trick questions and problems that require a single epiphany to solve.

6.  We check your references.
7.  We make you a job offer.

We also expect you to be interviewing us too, so ask us any questions you have along the way!

If you aren't ready to start interviewing, but are interested to stop by our San Francisco office to meet the team, let us know!
